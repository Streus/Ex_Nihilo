# Welcome to the Ex Nihilo project home.

Quick rundown of formatting tips:
* You can make lists with an asterisk "*"
* Headers are denoted by amounts of "#" - H1 through H6 based on the number
* Italics are *words in asterisks* "*"
* Bold with **double asterisks** "**"
* Strikethrough with ~~two tildes~~ "~~"

1. Numbered lists are just *a* number, doesn't matter which.
  1. Two spaces for indenting, sub-lists are automatic.

Links are like so: enclose the hypertext in square brackets "[]", and the link in parenthesis after "()".
Example: [Google](https://www.google.com)
